# IMPORTANT: this version of SendMap is old, see master1.1 for improved code with more features

# SendMAP
sends an email of a map, which you have to specify in a google spreadsheet

# How to get this working

1. Create a new Google spreadsheet
2. On the blank spreadsheet, go to the first cell in the upper left-hand corner (A1). It will be in column A and row 1, Now enter an address in that cell(example: Kannur, Airport) 
3. in the google spreadsheet go to 'tools' then script editor then copy and paste the script I added into this repo
4. replace the fake email with one of yours
5. run the sendMap() function
